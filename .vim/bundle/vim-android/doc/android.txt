INTRODUCTION                                     *android*

This plugin provides several convenience commands to make development for
android easier with VIM.

BUILD-COMMANDS                                   *android-build-commands*

The following is a list of Ex commands specific to build operations. These
commands closely resemble their ant equivalents.

Adebug                    Build the debug version of the current project.
                          Equivalent to calling `ant debug`
